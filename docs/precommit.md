# Pre-commit

Pre-commit hooks are used to ensure code quality and consistency before committing changes to the repository.

## How to use

To use the pre-commit hooks, follow these steps:

1. Install the pre-commit package: `pip install pre-commit`
2. Install the pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`
3. Run the pre-commit hooks manually: `pre-commit run --all-files`

These steps will help maintain code quality and prevent common issues before they are committed to the repository.
